\title{Nested Case-Control Study with a Time-Varying Exposure and a Cancer Outcome}
\format{A data frame with 600 observations on the following 14 variables.
\itemize{ \item\code{id}: subject ID.  \item\code{case}: indicator for case
(1) or control (0).  \item\code{age}: age of each subject.
\item\code{riskset}: risk set id.  \item\code{exp15}: yearly exposure in the
age period 15-19 year.  \item\code{exp20}: yearly exposure in the age period
20-24 year.  \item\code{...} \item\code{exp60}: yearly exposure in the age
period 60-64 year.  }}
\source{
These nested case-control data were extracted from a simulated
cohort with 300 cases of cancer and a time-varying exposure.
}
\description{
The data set contains simulated data from an hypothetical nested
case-control study on the association between a time-varying occupational
exposure and a cancer outcome. The study includes 300 risk sets, each with a
case and a control matched by age year. The data on the exposure is
collected on 5-year age intervals between 15 and 65 years.
}
\details{
The exposure history for each subject (series of yearly exposures) can be
recovered by expanding the values given in \code{exp15}-\code{exp60}, and
then selecting the values backward from the age of the subject for a given
lag period.
