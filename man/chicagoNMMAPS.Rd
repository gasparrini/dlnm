The sequence of observations \item\code{year}: Year \item\code{month}: Month
(numeric) \item\code{doy}: Day of the year \item\code{dow}: Day of the week
(factor) \item\code{death}: Counts of all cause mortality excluding accident
\item\code{cvd}: Cardiovascular Deaths \item\code{resp}: Respiratory Deaths
\item\code{temp}: Mean temperature (in Celsius degrees) \item\code{dptp}:
Dew point temperature \item\code{rhum}: Mean relative humidity

The complete dataset used to be available at the Internet-based
Health and Air Pollution Surveillance System (iHAPSS) website:

or through the packages \pkg{NMMAPSdata} or \pkg{NMMAPSlite}. Currently, the
data are not available any more and the two packages have been archived.

\description{
The data set contains daily mortality (all causes, CVD, respiratory),
weather (temperature, dew point temperature, relative humidity) and
pollution data (PM10 and ozone) for Chicago in the period 1987-2000 from the
National Morbidity, Mortality and Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS)
}
\details{
These data represents a subsample of the variables included in the NMMAPS
dataset for Chicago.

The variable \code{temp} is derived from the original \code{tmpd} after a
transformation from Fahrenheit to Celsius. The variables \code{pm10} and
\code{o3} are an approximated reconstruction of the original series, adding
the de-trended values and the median of the long term trend. This is the
reason they include negative values.

The application of DLNMs to this data with more detailed examples are given
in vignette \strong{dlnmExtended}.
