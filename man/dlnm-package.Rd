\title{
Distributed Lag Non-linear Models (DLNM)
}

\description{
The package \pkg{dlnm} contains functions to specify and interpret distributed lag linear (DLMs) and non-linear (DLNMs) models. These functions are used to build basis and cross-basis matrices and then to predict and plot the results of a fitted model.
}

\section{Modelling framework}{
Distributed lag non-linear models (DLNMs) represent a modelling framework to describe simultaneously non-linear and delayed dependencies, termed as \emph{exposure-lag-response associations}. These include models for linear exposure-responses (DLMs) as special cases. The methodology of DLMs and DLNMs was originally developed for time series data, and has been recently extended to other study designs and data structures, compatible with cohort, case-control or longitudinal analyses, amongst others. A thorough methodological overview is given in the references and the package vignettes detailed below.

The modelling framework is based on the definition of a \emph{cross-basis}, a bi-dimensional space of functions specifying the dependency along the space of the predictor and along lags. The cross-basis functions are built combining the basis functions for the two dimensions, produced by applying existing or user-defined functions such as splines, polynomials, linear threshold or indicators.

The application of DLMs and DLNMs requires the availability of predictor values measured at equally-spaced time points. In the original development in time series analysis, these are represented by the ordered series of observations. More generally, the data can be stored in a matrix of \emph{exposure histories}, where each row represents the lagged values of the predictor for each observation.

The cross-basis matrix of transformed variables is included in the model formula of a regression model to estimate the associated parameters. The estimation can be carried out with the default regression functions, such as \code{\link{lm}}, \code{\link{glm}}, \code{\link[mgcv]{gam}} (package \pkg{mgcv}), \code{\link[survival]{clogit}} and \code{\link[survival]{coxph}} (package \pkg{survival}), \code{\link[nlme]{lme}} (package \pkg{nlme}), \code{\link[lme4]{lmer}} and \code{\link[lme4]{glmer}} (package \pkg{lme4}), and \code{\link[glmmTMB]{glmmTMB}} (package \pkg{glmmTMB}). Estimates are then extracted to obtain predictions and graphical representations which facilitate the interpretation of the results.

\section{Functions and data included in the package}{
In the standard usage, \code{\link{crossbasis}} creates two set of basis functions from a time series vector or a matrix of exposure histories to define the relationship in the two dimensions of predictor and lags. This step is performed through a call to the function \code{\link{onebasis}}, which in turn internally calls existing or user-defined functions and produces a basis matrix of class \code{"crossbasis"} with specific attributes. Standard choices for the functions in the two dimension are \code{\link[splines]{ns}} or \code{\link[splines]{bs}} from package \pkg{splines}, or the internal functions \code{\link{poly}}, \code{\link{strata}}, \code{\link{thr}}, \code{\link{integer}} and \code{\link{lin}} in \pkg{dlnm}. Other existing of user-defined functions can be also chosen. The functions \code{\link{equalknots}} and \code{\link{logknots}} can be used for knot placement. The two basis matrices are then combined in a matrix object of class \code{"crossbasis"}, containing the transformed variables to be included in the model formula.

In a more recent development, a penalized version of DLMs and DLNMs can be performed using two alternative approaches. In the \emph{external} method, the functions \code{\link{ps}} or \code{\link{cr}} are called in \code{\link{crossbasis}} to derive the spline transformations, and the function \code{\link{cbPen}} is used to form the list of bi-dimensional penalty matrices. In the \emph{internal} method, the cross-basis parameterization and matrix penalization are obtained directly using \code{\link{smooth.construct.cb.smooth.spec}}, a specific smooth constructor of class \code{"cb"}. This is used within the function \code{\link[mgcv]{s}} in the model formula. In both cases, the model is fitted using the regression function \code{\link[mgcv]{gam}} in \pkg{mgcv}.

After the model fitting, \code{\link{crosspred}} generates predictions for a set of suitable values of the original predictor and lag period, and stores them in a \code{"crosspred"} object. The function \code{\link{exphist}} can be used to generate exposure histories for predictions. The fit of a DLM or DLNM can be reduced and re-expressed as the chosen function of one of the two dimensions through the function \code{\link{crossreduce}}. It returns a \code{"crossreduce"} object storing the new parameters and predictions.

Method functions are available for objects \code{"onebasis"}, \code{"crossbasis"}, \code{"crosspred"} and \code{"crossreduce"}. Specific \code{\link[=summary.crossbasis]{summary}} methods summarize the content of each object. The plotting functions \code{\link[=plot.crosspred]{plot}}, \code{\link[=lines.crosspred]{lines}} and \code{\link[=points.crosspred]{points}}, offer a set of choices to plot the results, while \code{\link[=coef.crosspred]{coef}} and \code{\link[=vcov.crosspred]{vcov}} return the coefficients and associated (co)variance matrix for a (optionally reduced) model.

The data set \code{\link{chicagoNMMAPS}} is provided to perform examples of use of \pkg{dlnm} in time series analysis. It includes time series data of daily mortality counts, weather and pollution variables for Chicago in the period 1987-2000. The data sets \code{\link{nested}} and \code{\link{drug}} include simulated data to illustrate the extension of \pkg{dlnm} to other study designs, specifically nested case-controls and randomized controlled trials. The former contains information on 300 risk sets each with one cancer case and one matched control, and an occupational exposure collected in 5-year periods. The latter contains information on 200 subjects who are randomly allocated a different dose of a drug for two out of four weeks, with their outcome measured after 28 days.
