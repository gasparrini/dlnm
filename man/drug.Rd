\title{A Trial on the Effect of Time-Varying Doses of a Drug}
\format{A data frame with 200 observations on the following 7 variables.
\itemize{ \item\code{id}: subject ID.  \item\code{out}: the outcome level
measured at day 28.  \item\code{sex}: the sex of the subject.
\item\code{day1.7}: daily dose for the first week.  \item\code{day8.14}:
daily dose for the second week.  \item\code{day15.21}: daily dose for the
third week.  \item\code{day22.28}: daily dose for the fourth week.  }}

\description{
The data set contains simulated data from an hypothetical randomized
controlled trial on the effect of time-varying doses of a drug. The study
include records for 200 randomized subjects, each receiving doses of a drug
randomly allocated in two out of four weeks, with daily doses varying each
week. The daily doses are reported on 7-day intervals corresponding to each
week.
}
\details{
The exposure history for each subject (series of daily doses from day 28 to
1) can be recovered by expanding the values given in
\code{day1.7}-\code{day22.28}.
