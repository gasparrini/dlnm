-----------------------------------

### Changes in dlnm 2.2.6 (11 Apr 2016)

#### Minor changes

  * Bug fixed in crossreduce when ncol of cb is 1.

-----------------------------------

### Changes in dlnm 2.2.5 (11 Apr 2016)

#### Major changes

  * The order of transformation in the tensor for cross-basis transformation is changed and now consistent with tensor.prod.model.matrix() in mgcv. This change affects crossbasis(), mkXpred() and crossreduce(), where the order between var-lag has been reversed. The development only concerns internal code and no change should be seen in the usage of dlnm.

#### Minor changes

  * Revised centering procedure to fix minor issues with centering selection with function 'strata', 'thr', 'integer'. Fixed in checkonebasis() and mkcen().

-----------------------------------

### Changes in dlnm 2.2.3 (15 Mar 2016)

#### Major changes

  * Centering procedure moved from onebasis() to crosspred()-crossreduce(). This change simplifies the steps of obtaining predictions with different references, as it avoids refitting the model. At the moment the inclusion  of 'ce' in onebasis()-crossbasis() generates a warning, but the info is kept internally and the old code should still work.

  * Consistently withe the change above, crosspred()-crossreduce() now have a 'cen' argument to specify the reference value.

  * Major changes in crosspred()-crossreduce(), with several auxiliary functions build to simplify the internal code. Specifically: mkat(), mkcen(), mklag(), mkXpred(). See the related help page.

  * New import of the function tensor.prod.model.matrix() from mgcv, to simplify the computation of the tensor product in crosspred().

  * Published code has been updated accordingly, and included in the related web pages at http://www.ag-myresearch.com/. The function attrdl() (not included in the package but used in published code) has been changed as
well.

#### Minor changes

  * Changed default for colour (now black) and frame (now bty=”l”) in plotting functions.
  
  * Namespace changed accordingly, with imports from mgcv.

  * Lag2() removed, back to Lag() imported from package tsModel.

  * Documentation changed accordingly, references updated.

-----------------------------------

### Changes in dlnm 2.1.4 (15 Jan 2015)

#### Minor changes

  * Changes in function strata(), now with possibility of setting 'ref=0', thus obtaining a different dummy parameterization.

  * Changes in summary.crossbasis() to print only a subset of long arguments

-----------------------------------

### Changes in dlnm 2.1.4 (14 Aug 2014)

#### Minor changes

  * Bug fixed in plot()-points()-lines() methods when model.link was not provided.

-----------------------------------

### Changes in dlnm 2.1.3 (05 Aug 2014)

-----------------------------------

### Changes in dlnm 2.1.2 (24 Jul 2014)

#### Minor changes

  * Negative lag can now be specified in crossbasis(), although presumably rarely needed.

-----------------------------------

### Changes in dlnm 2.1.0 (21 May 2014)

#### Minor changes

  * Added attribute 'df' in crossbasis objects, with df for each dimension.

  * Adjustment to the example on seasonal analysis.

  * References corrected.

-----------------------------------

### Changes in dlnm 2.0.9 (01 Apr 2014)

#### Major changes

  * Function strata() now accepts an additional argument 'ref' to select the reference category. Also, the intercept is now defined as a vector of 1's.

  * Old functions crossplot(), mkbasis() and mklagbasis() removed.

#### Minor changes

  * Functions now defined with unquoted names (problem with RStudio).

  * Internal functions now defined with names without initial dots.

  * checkgroup modified: now number of obs in each groups can also be less than df in argvar. Required in previous versions, not anymore.

  * Documentation changed accordingly, references updated.

-----------------------------------

### Changes in dlnm 2.0.6 (17 Oct 2013)

#### Minor changes

  * Included function equalknots() to place knots at equally-spaced values.

  * Changes in .get-() functions to allow changes in lme4 objects.

  * Error fixed in examples of vignette dlnmExtended.

-----------------------------------

### Changes in dlnm 2.0.3 (10 Sept 2013)

See also: file.show(system.file("Changesince200",package="dlnm"))

#### Major changes

  * The usage of functions crossbasis() and onebasis() has been extensively revised, as detailed below. The old usage is maintained with a warning for compatibility reasons. However, the old usage can return now different  results if compared to previous versions. See the file Changesince200 using the link above.

  * The functions in dlnm can now be used also for data other than time series. The only difference is the inclusion of a matrix of lagged occurrences as the 'x' argument of crossbasis, instead than the usual vector of time series data. The extension is detailed in the article Gasparrini Stat Med 2013 and in the new vignette 'dlnmExtended'.

  * The functions onebasis() now calls existing functions for generating the basis matrix. The functions poly(), strata(), thr(), integer() and lin() have been added, although not exported in the namespace. User-defined functions with attributes reporting the arguments exactly defining the transformation can be added as well.

  * Given the change above, the arguments of onebasis() and the list of arguments composing the arguments 'argvar' and 'arglag' in crossbasis() are now those of the called functions. In particular, the old usage is not guaranteed to work any more, and if it does a warning is reported.

  * The default knots placements for ns and bs functions for the lag dimension in crossbasis() is not at equally-spaced log-values as before, but at equally-spaced percentiles, consistently with the predictor space. The old default can be reproduced with the new function logknots().

  * Two new data sets included in the package, 'nested' and 'drug'. They are composed of simulated data on nested case-control and randomized controlled trial designs respectively.

  * The new function exphist() can be used to build matrices of exposure histories to be used in crosspred() to obtain specific predictions given an exposure profile.

  * The documentation of the package has beed extensively revised. The vignette 'dlnmOverview now provides a general introduction to the methodology and functions, while the two new vignettes 'dlnmTS' and 'dlnmExtended' describes specific applications in time series design and in other study designs, respectively.

#### Minor changes

  * Basis matrices now keep names from original vector/matrix.

  * Argument 'lag' in crossbasis() now given default value depending on the format of the argument 'x'.

  * Summary method functions have been changed accordingly.

  * Internal functions .getcoef(), .getvcov() and .getlink() added within crosspred(0 tro extract coef, vcov and model link.

  * Internal functions .checkgroup(), .oldonebasis and .oldcrossbasis() for checks in onebasis() and crossbasis().

  * Print of summary.crossreduce() fixed.

  * Second example in vignette about seasonal analysis has been corrected. Now the model includes also a term for trend, forgotten so far.

  * Terminology in documentation largely revised.

#### Minor changes

  * In onebasis(), now strata defined by 'bound', not range, and reported.

  * Bug fixed in names assignment to objects in crossreduce().

  * Bug fixed in crosspred() for argument 'bylag'.

-----------------------------------

### Changes in dlnm 1.6.2 (17 Apr 2012)

#### Major changes

#### Minor changes

  * Documentation changed accordingly.

-----------------------------------

### Changes in dlnm 1.6.1 (13 Apr 2012)

#### Major changes

  * The usage of crossbasis() has been extensively revised. Now the function has 2 arguments var and lag with a list of arguments for each space. Also, maxlag has been replaced by lag, defining the lag range (min and max). Old usage has been kept (with a warning) for compatibility reasons. 

  * New function crossreduce() to reduce the fit to one of the 2 dimensions. Methods functions (summary, plot, points, lines) are also included.

  *	crosspred() changed accordingly: now prediction also from simple basis, and computation based on faster new method in crossreduce().
